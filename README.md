# 🎓 EduFlow - Student Materials Recommendation System

EduFlow is a full-stack web application that recommends YouTube videos based on students' marks and subjects. It is designed to help learners access study material at the right difficulty level, saving time and improving motivation.

## Problem Statement

In today’s digital learning environment, students have unlimited access to online resources. However, they often struggle to find content suitable for their current learning level. Beginners can be overwhelmed by advanced tutorials, while advanced students may get bored with basic content.

## Our Solution

EduFlow solves this problem by allowing students to enter their subject and marks. Based on their marks, EduFlow categorizes students into beginner, intermediate, or advanced levels, and recommends five YouTube videos tailored to their level.

### Key Features

- Personalized recommendations based on subject and marks
- Real-time video fetch using YouTube Data API v3
- Simple, interactive, and user-friendly interface
- Beginner, intermediate, and advanced-level categorization
- Built with React + Vite + TypeScript frontend and Ballerina backend

### Future Considerations

- Transition from rule-based logic to machine learning for smarter, adaptive recommendations.
- Deploy on free cloud-based platforms to increase accessibility.
- Expand to include additional resources like PDFs, quizzes, and interactive exercises.

EduFlow makes learning easier, faster, and more engaging by providing the right resources exactly when they are needed.
